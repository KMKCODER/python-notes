# Computers want to be helpful
Computers wan to do things but we need to speak their langauge to describe what we want done. instructions are put into the computer for a user to just pick and use.

## Users Vs Programmers
* Users see computers as a set of tools.
* Programmers learn the computer "ways" and the computer language.
* Programmers have some tools that allow them to build new tools.
* Programmers sometimes write tools for lots of users and sometimes programmers write "helpers" for themselves to automate a task.
